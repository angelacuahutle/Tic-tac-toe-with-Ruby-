# Tic-tac-toe-with-Ruby-

> In this project, we built a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's (noughts and crosses). This has been implemented using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby Language.
